# Lab 1
## Task 1
Create a MATLAB program to calculate the running mean of a signal.

Uses a function `init_running_mean` to initialize a structure for calculating the running mean.

Another function `calc_running_mean` then uses the structure to
calculate the running mean of a signal.

A script for testing the correctness of the functions described above will be written.

## Task 2
Rewrite Task 1 in C.

## Task 3
Modify the sample program to use the running mean filter from Task 2 on the STM32L476G Discover board.
