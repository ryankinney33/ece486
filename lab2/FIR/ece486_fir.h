 *
 * Implementation of FIR filters for in which a very long input sequence
 * x[n] can be processed by breaking the input sequence into fixed length blocks.
 *
 * Filters are initialized by a single call to init_fir(), which allocates
 * and initializes a filter descriptor structure of type FIR_T
 *
 * @code
 *    #include "ece486_fir.h"
 *    ...
 *    FIR_T  *filt;
 *    ...
 *    // Define an impulse response vector h of length M...
 *    // Allocate memory for inputs x[i] and outputs y[i] of length "blocksize"...
 *    ...
 *    filt = init_fir(h,M,blocksize);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once a filter descriptor is initialized, repeated calls to calc_fir()
 * provide the filter outputs, where the input samples are provided in fixed
 * length blocks of "blocksize" samples at a time.
 *
 * @code
 *    while( ...input sample blocks are available...) {
 *       // fill the vector x[i] with the next "blocksize" samples from the input sequence.
 *       calc_fir(filt, x, y);
 *       // do something with the filter output samples y[i].
 *    }
 * @endcode
 *
 * When processing completes, destroy_fir() should be called to release
 * any allocated memory.
 *
 * @code
 *    destroy_fir(filt);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note
 * All input and output vectors (x[i] and y[i]) must be allocated by the caller.
 *
 * @note
 * The input and output arrays MAY point to the same location, in which case the
 * input sequence x[i] is replaced by the output
 * sequence y[i] in the calls to calc_fir().

 * @brief Calculate a block of output samples of an FIR filter from an input sample block
 *
 * Calling calc_fir() repeatedly generates the filter output for an arbitrary sequence
 * of input samples.  The FIR filter output samples y(n) are given by
 * @verbatim
 *
 *                    i=n_coef-1
 *              y(n) =    sum     h(i) x(n-i)
 *                        i=0
 * @endverbatim
 * For each call, an input block of samples @a x[i] with length "blocksize" (as specified
 * in init_fir() ) is processed to generate the corresponding output samples
 * in the output vector @a y[i]. In subsequent calls to calc_fir(), the
 * new input blocks @a x[i] are assumed to follow the input blocks provided in
 * the previous calls to calc_fir().  As a result, very long input sequences
 * may be processed by breaking the sequence into many fixed-length blocks of
 * "blocksize" samples.
 *
 * Memory required to store the output vector @a y[i] must be allocated by the
 * caller.
 *
 * \note
 *   @a x and @a y CAN point to the same location.  In this case, the filter output
 *   samples will replace the input sample array.
 *
 * @returns On return, y[i] contains the calculated output samples.
 *  (The contents of the structure @a *s are also modified to keep track of the filter state.)
