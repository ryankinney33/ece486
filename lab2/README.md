# Lab 2
## Task 1
FIR Filters: Write and test your C-code implementations of discrete-time convolution using a predefined function interface as provided on the lab web site (Don's site).
Use file names of ece486_fir.c and ece486_fir.h to provide your implementation of the described interface. 

You are not allowed to change the format or name of any of the function calls, or the file names containing your implementation.
Develop a separate routine to test your code, and document your test results.
